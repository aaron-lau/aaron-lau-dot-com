## Introduction

After spending over 4 years in New York City, I've compiled a comprehensive list of must-visit spots and activities. Whether you're a first-time visitor or a local looking for new experiences, this guide will help you navigate the city's diverse neighborhoods and boroughs. The list is organized by boroughs and neighborhoods, providing you with a convenient way to explore each area's unique attractions. Please note that the list is not ranked in order of preference unless otherwise specified, making it easier for you to plan your itinerary.

## Intended Audience

This blog post is intended for readers looking for recommendations beyond the typical main stream attractions such as the Empire State Building or Statue of Liberty. Although those are great sites you should visit, I try to recommend some more local spots.

Particularly I will be giving recommendations for those who like to site see üì∑, to eat üçî, and to drink üç∏.

## Prerequisites

- Download the Resy app and make your reservations as soon as possible! You do not want to do a walk in only to find out that the wait time is 90 minutes.
- Make sure you have plenty of data. Not only will you need data to navigate, but you'll want data to look up any subway service changes, opening hours of businesses, and nowadays to be able to scan QR codes for food menus.

## Financial District

Let's start our journey in the world-renowned Financial District. Almost any subway will take you to this bustling area:

- Oculus Building: Known for its futuristic architecture resembling an alien spaceship, the Oculus is a unique landmark. While it offers shops on the lower level, there's not much else to do inside.
- Adjacent to the Oculus is the World Trade Center and the poignant 9/11 Memorial Pools.
- Heading south, you'll reach Wall Street, home to various financial institutions including the New York Stock Exchange Building.
- Continuing further south, you'll encounter the Charging Bull and the Fearless Girl statues.

From this point, you have several options:

- Purchase a ferry ticket to explore the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.
  - Alternatively, if you're not keen on visiting the islands but still want a close view of the Statue, opt for the free Staten Island ferry round trip.
- Embark on a walk across the iconic Brooklyn Bridge into Brooklyn. While it might be crowded with fellow tourists, the breathtaking views make the trek worthwhile (approximately a 60-minute walk).
- If you're feeling hungry, head to Chinatown for an array of dining options.

### Honorable Mentions in the Financial District

Don't miss City Hall and the East River Piers for a scenic waterfront stroll.

## Chinatown

Chinatown holds a special place in my heart, serving as my go-to spot for groceries and affordable eats. Let's dive into the best culinary experiences in this vibrant neighborhood:

- Dim Sum: Consider Golden Unicorn, House of Joy, or Jing Fong for a delightful brunch. Be prepared for a wait of around 30 minutes on busy weekend mornings. Non-Chinese speakers might find Golden Unicorn less chaotic.
- Hong Kong Style Breakfast: Check out Kong Sihk Tong, Manu Cafe, or Cha Kee. These options offer fantastic breakfasts with varying wait times.
- Rice Noodles: Don't miss Chang Lai Fishballs Noodles (limited seating) or Yin Ji Chang Fen for a tasty snack.
- Craving Pho? Try Th√°i S∆°n or Pho Grand.
- For South Asian flavors, Nyonya and Wok Wok are great choices.
- Bakeries: Mei Lai Wan (famous baked pork buns), Fay Da Bakery, and Tai Pan Bakery.
- Indulge your sweet tooth at The Original Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. You'll also find numerous Bubble tea shops for a refreshing treat.

Be sure to carry cash, as some establishments may not accept credit cards. Avoid purchasing fake designer goods from dubious vendors. If you're in the mood for Pizza and Pasta, Little Italy is conveniently located near Chinatown.

### Honorable Mentions in Chinatown

- Explore other cash-only gems like Shu Jiao Fu Zhou and Great NY Noodletown.
- Stroll along bustling Pell Street.
- Check out Canal Street Market, a modern hub featuring local vendors.

## Soho

Soho is synonymous with shopping, drawing in crowds of millionaires, tourists, and social media influencers. In New York City, anything priced under $110 avoids the 8.875% sales tax, making it a prime shopping destination.

When it comes to dining, Soho has a variety of options to explore:

- Ruby's Cafe: A quintessential brunch spot.
- Thai Diner: Offering a unique take on Thai cuisine.
- Egg Shop: Known for its delicious egg sandwiches.
- Cafe Habana: Serving up Cuban and Mexican bites.

### Honorable Mentions in Soho

- Sneaker enthusiasts must visit the Stadium Goods store.
- Explore the multi-level Nike store with a basketball court on the top level.
- Need a restroom? Head to the basement level of Bloomingdale's.
- Dominique Ansel Bakery is renowned for its cronut, although I haven't personally tried it.

## Lower East Side

The Lower East Side is a hub for dining, drinks, and a lively nightlife. Here are some top recommendations:

- Bars: One must-visit spot is the Double Chicken Please Coop, formerly known as Double Chicken Please backroom. Check Resy for reservations. It's one of the [world's best bars](https://www.worlds50bestbars.com/the-list/double-chicken-please.html).
- The Back Room: A prohibition-era speakeasy where patrons sip cocktails from teacups. Note that the age requirement is 25+ on Fridays and Saturdays.
- Bar GOTO: An intimate Japanese cocktail lounge.
- Welcome to the Johnsons: A gritty dive bar with $2 PBRs.
- Bar Belly: A cozy bar with excellent Happy Hour deals, including $1 oysters.
- Sour Mouse: A social lounge with Beer Pong, Pool, and Ping Pong. No cover charge from what I recall.
- Boho Karaoke: Whether you prefer communal or private karaoke, this BYOB spot has you covered.

Indulge in some fantastic eats as well:

- Pig and Khao: Dive into mouthwatering Filipino cuisine.
- Beauty & Essex: Hidden behind a Pawn Shop, this spot offers high-end American food.
- Potluck Club: A cantonese-inspired brunch and dinner spot with a modern twist.

### Honorable Mentions in the Lower East Side

- Dance the night away at Pianos, a popular dance club.
- Mr. Purple offers a rooftop bar experience with a swimming pool (though I have only been there for a coporate event)
- Explore Ye‚Äôs Apothecary, a Sichuan cocktail lounge.

## East Village

Moving north from the Lower East Side, you'll find the East Village, known for its youthful energy and proximity to New York University campus.

Bars:

- Don't miss Please Don't Tell, a speakeasy accessible through a hotdog store's red phone booth. Reservations on Resy are recommended.
- Death & Co: An intimate, dimly lit cocktail bar.
- Burp Castle: A quiet bar where conversations are whispered.
- Sake Bar Decibel: A dark and atmospheric Japanese sake bar.

For dining options:

- St. Marks Place is go to spot. When in doubt begin your search there.
- Enjoy Thai cuisine at Fish Cheeks, Soothr, or Somtum Der.
- Experience the vibrant atmosphere of Panna II Garden, an Indian restaurant with bright lights d√©cor.
- Indulge in non-vegan Sichuan cuisine at Mala Project or opt for vegan options at Spicy Moon.
- Wrap up your night with a tasty burger at 7th Street Burger.

### Honorable Mentions in the East Village

- Don't miss ARIARI, Kimura, Raku (not unique to NYC), Ho Foods, and Sushi by M for other Asian food experiences.
- Note that the East Village tends to attract a younger crowd due to its proximity to New York University.

## West Village

On the west side of Manhattan, you'll find the West Village, a counterpart to the East Village with its own charm and Michelin-starred restaurants.

For bars, check out another [world famous bar](https://www.worlds50bestbars.com/the-list/katana-kitten.html) Katana Kitten. If the wait is too long, head across the street to Employees Only another excellent and exclusive bars.

Food:

- Indulge in French cuisine at Boucherie.
- Savor Michelin-starred Korean flavors at Jeju Noodle Bar.
- Enjoy great Italian pizza and pasta at Olio E Pi√π.

Don't miss the Comedy Cellar, a renowned comedy club where many famous comedians got their start. The area also hosts many jazz bars such as Blue Note.

### Honorable Mentions in the West Village

- Consider visiting the unique Pier with its scenic view of the Hudson River and New Jersey from the west side's pier.

## Chelsea

There is a nice scenic walk I recommend for all those capable. Begin your day with a walk in Chelsea Market. Check out the interior of the building as well as the cobblestone streets on the outside. I recommend grabbing some bites and a to-go drink that you can carry for the next 2 hours.

Next make your way to the Little Island. It‚Äôs a recently built man-made attraction where you can walk around before making your way back to way you came. You‚Äôll want to follow the signs for the High Line.

The High Line is a repurposed above ground railroad turned into a walkway. You can start near 12th Street and walk all the way to 30th street where you‚Äôll end up near the Vessel and Hudson Yards.
The walk gives you a perspective above the busy streets of New York and you can also gaze and the luxury sky rises in the Chelsea neighborhood.

After getting off the High Line, look up at the honeycomb looking structure - the Vessel. Walk into the Hudson Yard shopping mall for some much needed air conditioning.

### Honorable mentions in Chelsea

- If you have time check out Chelsea Piers. There‚Äôs plenty to do there - driving range, sports, mini golf, skatepark, etc.
- If you like to club, there‚Äôs the Marquee Night Club. Big names play here on weekends. Get tickets online.

## Korea Town

K-town might consist of just a few streets, but it's packed with hidden gems for food and drinks, making it a perfect midtown haven.

Eateries:

- For Korean BBQ, check out Baekjeong, Dons Bogam, or Jongro. Some swear by one as the best, but it's a matter of personal preference.
- Try BCD Tofu House for delicious Korean stews.
- Korean Fried Chicken at bbq chicken, Pelicana chicken, and Turntable Chicken.

Bars:

- Pocha 32, The Maze 32, MUI, and Soju Haus are known for their vibrant atmosphere. They all blur together after a while.
- Osamil Upstairs offers a unique speakeasy experience.

No visit to K-town is complete without karaoke. Consider Karaoke WOW, 32 Karaoke, or Karaoke Duet 35.

### Honorable Mentions in Korea Town

- Grab quick, tasty meals at Woorijip.
- If you're into clubbing, check out Maru.

## Midtown

While Midtown might not be the most picturesque area, it offers something for everyone.

- Scattered across Midtown are theaters for broadway shows. If you don‚Äôt care about where you sit in the theatre, sign up for the broadway lotteries. Tickets are usually available two weeks before the show date. Check out <https://lottery.broadwaydirect.com/> and <https://www.luckyseat.com/home>.
- Enjoy Bryant Park, the largest park in Midtown aside from Central Park, featuring various events year-round.
- Explore the impressive murals at the old New York Public Library and the new one, where you'll find clean public bathrooms.
- Wander along 5th Ave to discover luxury stores, with St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockefeller Center as highlights.
- While Times Square is a must-see, be cautious of hustlers and avoid accepting handouts.

### Honorable Mentions in Midtown

- For outstanding tacos, head to Los Tacos No. 1. Their menu is a must-try. I recommend trying one of each taco.
- Experience unique ramen at Ichiran Ramen, an individual booth-style eatery.

## Central Park/Upper East Side/Upper West Side

While I don't have as many local recommendations for these areas, don't miss The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Natural History Museum. To get tickets, never buy online or on the kiosks on site. Instead line up at the front desk and donate your desired amount after providing a New York City zipcode. The Guggenheim Museum is also in the Upper East Side with the iconic spiral architecture.

For Central Park, explore on foot, by Citi bike, or via electric scooter. For scooters, there are local businesses selling use of e-scooters by the hour near Central Park. For Citi bikes, there will be plenty of Citi bike docks on the perimeter. I enjoy starting from the south of the park and making my way up until around 96th street where you can exit either on the East or West side.

### Honorable in Upper Manhattan

Between Manhattan and Queens is a small island called Roosevelt Island. There are some Cherry blossom trees there that you can see bloom in the spring time but other than that there's not much to do on the island itself. Getting to the island is the fine part. At 2nd Ave and 59th St there is an entrance to the Roosevelt Island Tramway. It costs the same as a regular MTA ride and you'll be able to ride a tram over the water. Much cooler than the underground subway.

## Brooklyn (Coming Soon)

## Queens (Coming Soon)

## Conclusion

That is everything I have for now. I'll update this page with my Brooklyn and Queens recommendations soon. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Enjoy exploring the city's vibrant and diverse offerings!
