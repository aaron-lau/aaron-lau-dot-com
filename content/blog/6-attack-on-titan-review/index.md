## Why I Finally Started Attack on Titan (In English)

For years, I avoided Attack on Titan. Despite its massive popularity and friends constantly telling me "you HAVE to watch it," I kept thinking: "Giant naked people eating humans? That sounds weird." In January 2024, during a particularly cold weekend, I finally gave in. As someone who typically prefers to multitask while watching shows, I opted for the English dub – a choice that proved surprisingly excellent.

## The Dub vs. Sub Debate

Before diving into the series itself, let's address the elephant in the room: yes, I watched it dubbed. While anime purists might cringe, Attack on Titan's English dub is exceptional. Bryce Papenbrook's portrayal of Eren evolves beautifully from hot-headed teenager to complex antagonist. Trina Nishimura's Mikasa and Josh Grelle's Armin provide emotional depth that resonates even in English.

The dub particularly shines in key emotional moments. Eren's famous "tatakae" (fight) scene hits differently in English, but maintains its raw intensity. The voice direction during The Rumbling arc is especially noteworthy – you can hear Eren's voice mature and change as his character evolves.

## A Note on Language and Impact

Watching the dub allowed me to focus entirely on the stunning visuals without dividing my attention between reading subtitles and watching the animation. During complex action sequences using ODM gear, this proved particularly valuable. However, I did switch to subbed for a few iconic scenes out of curiosity – "shinzou wo sasageyo" just hits different in Japanese.

Some nuances are inevitably lost in translation. The distinction between "shingeki" (advance/attack) and "jin" (person/people) in the Japanese title "Shingeki no Kyojin" adds layers of meaning that "Attack on Titan" doesn't quite capture. Still, the English script manages to convey the core themes effectively.


## The Benefit of Binge-Watching

There's something unique about watching Attack on Titan in 2025. While original fans waited years between seasons and had time to build theories and expectations, I had the privilege (or perhaps curse) of consuming the entire story in just a few weeks. No waiting years to learn what's in the basement. No time to develop elaborate theories about the ending. Just pure, uninterrupted storytelling.

## Season 1: The Hook

The first few episodes hit exactly as advertised – humanity trapped behind walls, fighting giant monsters. I understood the hype around the animation, especially the ODM gear sequences. But what caught me off guard was the emotional depth. By episode 5, when Eren's mother is eaten, I realized this wasn't just an action series about killing giants.

I remember texting my friend: "Okay, I get why people love this show." Little did I know how much deeper it would go.

## The Gradual Perspective Shift

One of the most fascinating aspects of binge-watching is experiencing the story's dramatic tone shift in rapid succession. In Season 1, I was fully on board with Eren's "kill all titans" mentality. By Season 3, I was questioning everything I thought I knew. And when Season 4 hit – well, let's just say I needed a break to process the complete genre shift.

The basement reveal hit differently in 2025. While watching, I was already aware that anime had evolved beyond simple good-vs-evil narratives, thanks to shows like Chainsaw Man and Jujutsu Kaisen. But Attack on Titan's transformation from a survival horror story into a complex political drama still felt revolutionary.

## Experiencing "The Rumbling" in One Go

I can't imagine what it was like waiting months between episodes during The Final Season. Watching The Rumbling arc in a few sittings was emotionally exhausting. The series doesn't let you look away from the horror – civilians being crushed, children crying, entire cultures wiped out. Seeing Eren transform from the protagonist I cheered for in Season 1 to this unstoppable force of destruction was particularly impactful without a break between episodes.

## About That Ending

Coming to the series fresh, without years of fan theories or expectations, might have helped me appreciate the ending more than those who watched it as it aired. The destruction of Paradis years after Eren's death didn't feel like a betrayal – it felt like the only honest conclusion possible.

Here's why the ending worked for me:

1. **No Time for Headcanon**: Without years to imagine different endings, I took the story as it came. Each revelation built naturally on what came before.

2. **Clear Theme Progression**: Binge-watching made it easier to track the series' consistent themes about cycles of violence and the cost of freedom.

3. **Character Evolution**: Watching Eren's transformation over a few weeks rather than years made his character arc feel more cohesive. His final actions, while tragic, felt consistent with his character's evolution.

## The Binge-Watch Experience

For those considering starting the series now, here's my advice:

1. **Pace Yourself**: While it's tempting to watch it all at once, the emotional weight of later episodes benefits from some processing time.

2. **Avoid Spoilers**: Even years after the ending, major plot points can still surprise new viewers.

3. **Pay Attention Early**: Details from the first season become incredibly significant later.

4. **Take Breaks**: Especially during Season 4 – the heavy themes need time to digest.

## A Note on the Soundtrack

Special mention must be made of Hiroyuki Sawano's soundtrack. As a new viewer, I was struck by how the music evolved with the series. From the militaristic anthems of early seasons to the haunting tracks of The Rumbling, the score perfectly captures the series' transformation.

## Final Thoughts

Coming to Attack on Titan in 2025 offered a unique viewing experience. Without the weight of years of fan theories and expectations, I could appreciate the story purely as it was presented. The ending, controversial as it may be, feels like the natural conclusion to a story that was never about easy answers or happy endings.

To those who still haven't watched it: Yes, it's about giant naked people eating humans. But it's also one of the most thoughtful examinations of freedom, conflict, and human nature in any medium. Don't wait years like I did to experience it.

And to those who watched it as it aired: I envy your experience of being part of the journey, but I'm grateful for the chance to experience this masterpiece in my own way.

Whether you choose sub or dub, Attack on Titan's story transcends language barriers. The themes of freedom, conflict, and the cost of war remain powerful in any tongue. Though I may have experienced it through English voices, the impact of this masterpiece wasn't lost in translation.

Shinzou wo Sasageyo! (I finally understand what that means now, in both languages.)
