Welcome to my blog site ðŸ¤—! I plan to use these blogs as a place for writing rants, thoughts, reviews, experiences, notes, and just about anything that comes to mind. Stay tuned!

Oh, and hereâ€™s a random quote from this Wikipedia on [salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg)
> _A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed, wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color._
