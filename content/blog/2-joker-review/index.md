## Preconception

I recently saw [The Joker](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286456/) movie staring Joaquin Phoenix. My expectations were high for this movie. There was tons of advertising and very bold claims from the media. I must say that I have not read any DC comics or and Batman comics. My only exposure to the Joker character are in Tim Burton's
film [_Batman_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/?ref_=nv_sr_3?ref_=nv_sr_3), Christopher Nolan's film [_The Dark Knight_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ref_=tt_sims_tt), and (unfortunately) David Ayer's film [_Suicide Squad_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386697/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1). However, none of these movies focusing on the origins of the Joker and this was my first exposure to the villian's background. The following is my review and interpretation of the movie. WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!

## Trailer:

## Actors:

I think Joaquin did a great job portraying the Joker and showing the origins of the comic book character. His acting was phenomenon and you got to see him display a wide range of emotions from happiness, sadness, anger, and even love. Other supporting actors such as Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, Frances Conroy and Joker's mother, and Brett Cullen and Thomas Wayne were good but nothing spectacular. Joaquin was the true centerpiece of the movie and I feel like the movie would not have been as enjoyable without him. As his character evolved throughout the movie his acting just getting better and better.

## Story:

The Joker's origin story is dark and sad. You get to see an adopted mental deranged man struggle in the captialistic world. It was interesting to see chapters of the Joker life that one might have never even thought a man like him went through. Hardships such as struggling with a job, getting beat on a subway, and caring for his hospitalized mother humanizes Arthur Fleck but ultimately push his over board to become the Joker. All that being said, I do think this movie was a bit slow. There were __several__ times when I closed my eyes for a couple seconds because I knew we had reached a _slow_ part of the movie (but this might have also been because I was watching the last showing on a workday evening). Near the end of the movie is where things started to get interesting. You get to see Arthur Fleck, a miserable comic, become more like the lively sinister Joker we are used. However I would say this was only the last 30% of the movie.

Some people may say this movie is too dark and I even heard of people having to leave the theatre because they could not bare to see the scenes. All I have to say to these people is: "What were you expecting? Were you expecting a movie about a clown causing mischief". Perhaps these viewers were used to the PG-13 batman movies. Viewer discretion is advised as this is a rated R movie!

From my limited knowledge about the Batman universe, it was nice to see Gotham City and some familiar faces. The eerie confrontation between Arthur and Alfred Pennyworth and young Bruce Wayne at Wayne manor would give the slightests of fan goosebumps. Evening at the end, you get to see an interpretation of the Wayne alley murder caused by the Joker's riots.

## Conclusion:

I would give this movie a 4/5. Joaquin does a great job portraying the Joker but I feel like it would fall short if it weren't for his diverse and suburb acting. The Joker is a good movie but my expectations were higher.
